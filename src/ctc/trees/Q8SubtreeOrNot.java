// You have two very large binary trees: Tl, with millions of nodes, and T2, with
// hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide ifT2 is a subtree ofTl.
// A tree T2 is a subtree of Tl if there exists a node n in Tl such that the subtree ofn
// is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be
// identical.
